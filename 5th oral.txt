 Here are some oral questions and answers about encryption and decryption using the RSA algorithm, explained in simple and concise language:

Q1: What is RSA encryption?
A1: RSA encryption is a method of encrypting data using a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.

Q2: How does RSA encryption work?
A2: RSA encryption involves converting the plaintext message into a numeric representation, raising it to the power of the public key exponent, and applying modular arithmetic using the modulus.

Q3: What is the purpose of the public key in RSA encryption?
A3: The public key is used to encrypt the plaintext message. It is freely shared with anyone who wants to send an encrypted message to the recipient.

Q4: What is the purpose of the private key in RSA encryption?
A4: The private key is used to decrypt the ciphertext message. It should be kept secret and securely stored by the recipient.

Q5: How is the public key generated in RSA encryption?
A5: The public key is generated by choosing two large prime numbers, calculating the modulus and Euler's totient function, and selecting a public exponent that is coprime with the totient function.

Q6: How is the private key generated in RSA encryption?
A6: The private key is generated by calculating the modular multiplicative inverse of the public exponent modulo the totient function.

Q7: How is the plaintext message encrypted using RSA?
A7: The plaintext message is converted into a numeric representation, raised to the power of the public exponent, and applied modular arithmetic using the modulus to obtain the ciphertext.

Q8: How is the ciphertext message decrypted using RSA?
A8: The ciphertext message is raised to the power of the private exponent, and modular arithmetic is applied using the modulus to obtain the numeric representation of the original plaintext.

Q9: What is the security strength of RSA encryption based on?
A9: The security of RSA encryption relies on the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers, which makes it computationally intensive to determine the private key from the public key.

Q10: Is RSA encryption suitable for encrypting large amounts of data directly?
A10: No, RSA encryption is relatively slow compared to symmetric key algorithms. In practice, RSA is often used to encrypt a symmetric key, which is then used for encrypting the actual message using a faster symmetric encryption algorithm.



These questions and answers provide a brief and easy-to-understand overview of encryption and decryption using the RSA algorithm.
